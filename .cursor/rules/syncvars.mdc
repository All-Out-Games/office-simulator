# SyncVars

SyncVars wrap a primative and automatically keep it in sync for all clients and the server
For example, to store "Health" on a Player, you can add a SyncVar as a field of your player class:

public partial class BattlePlayer : Player
{
  public SyncVar<int> Health = new(100);
}
The Health variable can be used normally (e.g. if (Health <= 0))
To respond to a SyncVar changing you can use .OnSync(old, new)


When declaring SyncVars make sure to call the constructor. 


SyncVars only support the following types:
- int
- float
- bool
- string
- Vector2
- Vector3
- Vector4
- Entity
