# CameraControl Reference

You can create CameraControls with `CameraControl.Create(layer)`, the highest layer camera that exists will be what the player sees.

Control Zoom with .Zoom
> Good values are between 0.8f and 2f the lower the closer the zoom.

Most games will want a CameraControl on their player to start with
```cs
public CameraControl CameraControl;

In your player Awake (with an IsLocal check). 
CameraControl = CameraControl.Create(0);
CameraControl.Zoom = 1.45f;
```

If you create a CameraControl, make sure to make it follow the player by setting its Position in the player's LateUpdate. 
```cs
public override void LateUpdate()
{
    if (IsLocal)
    {
        CameraControl.Position = Vector2.Lerp(CameraControl.Position, Entity.Position + new Vector2(0, 0.5f), 0.5f);
    }
}
```

You can create additional cameras in other components with higher layers to override. 
Don't forget to destroy them when you're done!
