# Ad Reference

## Rewarded Ads
First set up the ad handler on the server as a system (you can put this in GameManager if it exists)
public class AdSystem : System<AdSystem>
{
  public override void Awake()
  {
    if (Network.IsServer)
    {
      Ads.SetRewardHandler(OnAdReward);
    }
  }

  private bool OnAdReward(Player _player, string adId)
  {
    <!-- Cast to their custom player -->
    var player = (MyPlayer)_player;

    if (adId == "ANY_STRING")
    {
      <!-- Let the developer do what they want -->

      return true;
    }


    return false;
  }
}

Then on the client, whenever you want the rewarded ad to be prompted (this will open a dialog)
Ads.PromptRewardedAd("ANY_STRING", "75XP", "Watch to get 75XP", Assets.GetAsset<Texture>("$AO/new/icons/Video.png"));

## Interstitial Ads
if (Network.IsClient)
{
  if (Ads.IsInterstitialAdLoaded())
  {
    Ads.ShowInterstitial();
  }
}
